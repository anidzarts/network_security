The app is available at https://self-monitor3000.herokuapp.com/

## Getting started

**Create a database in whatever way is more suitable for you** e.g. Docker, ElephantSQL, PostgeSQL running locally on your machine, etc. all will work just fine. Below I'll show steps for setting up a DB with Docker, **but please feel free to use a method of your choice.**
## Running the application

To run the application you should use the following command in the location of the app.js file

```shell
deno run --allow-all --allow-env --unstable app.js
```

After it you can test the aplication opening  the following link in a browser:
